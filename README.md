## What is this?

The NEX game server for **Mario Kart 8 Deluxe** on [Nextendo Network](https://nextendo.network).
It handles authentication, matchmaking, and the in-game online session (worldwide races and
in-game lobbies), speaking the same NEX protocol the retail servers did.

It is built on the [**nextendo-nex**](https://github.com/NextendoNetwork/nextendo-nex) core, which
provides the PRUDP transport, RMC layer, and common service protocols.

## Running

```sh
cp example.env .env    # then edit .env
go run .
```

Configuration is entirely through environment variables — see [`example.env`](example.env). No
secrets are baked into the source: the auth/secure password, internal key, and token secret are all
read from the environment at startup.

## What this is not

This server ships **no** Nintendo code, keys, or copyrighted assets. It is an independent
reimplementation for use with a community-run replacement service, not affiliated with, endorsed by,
or associated with Nintendo. The NEX access key it uses is a well-known per-title value derivable
from the game itself, not a secret.
